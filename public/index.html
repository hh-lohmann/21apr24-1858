        This is meant to have some smallest demos for smallest concepts one might (will) encounter in ReactJS. No

        <a href="https://stackblitz.com/">StackBlitz</a> offers some kind of micro online IDEs eg. for React, giving an
        out-of-the-box experience reachable from arbitrary machines without special installations.
        <b>We will know more about stability and performance of this approach soon</b>.
